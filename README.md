Explanation:
Destructuring:

The address, contact, and preferences objects are destructured to extract only the required properties (city, country, coordinates, etc.).
Nested destructuring is used to directly access properties inside deeper levels of the object.
Return Object:

The extracted properties are assembled into a new object using object shorthand (e.g., { name, city, country, ... }).
Spread Operator:

The spread operator isn't strictly necessary here, but it can be used if additional properties need to be merged dynamically into the resulting object.
